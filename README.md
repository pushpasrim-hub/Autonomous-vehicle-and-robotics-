Autonomous Vehicles and Robotics

This project explores the integration of autonomous systems and robotics, combining cutting-edge technologies to enable machines to perceive, plan, and act in real-world environments without human intervention.

Overview

Autonomous Vehicles: These are self-driving systems capable of navigating without human input. They rely on sensors (LiDAR, cameras, radar), real-time data processing, and AI algorithms to make decisions and control movement.

Robotics: This field involves designing and programming robots that can perform tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously. When combined with autonomous navigation, robots can operate in dynamic or unstructured environments such as warehouses, homes, or outdoor terrain.


Key Features

Sensor Fusion: Combining data from various sensors for accurate environment perception.

Localization & Mapping: Using SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) for navigation and spatial awareness.

Path Planning: Algorithms like A*, RRT, and Dijkstra for obstacle avoidance and efficient route selection.

Control Systems: Implementing PID controllers, state machines, or deep reinforcement learning for motion control.

Simulation: Testing and validating models in virtual environments (e.g., Gazebo, CARLA).


Use Cases

Self-driving cars and delivery bots
